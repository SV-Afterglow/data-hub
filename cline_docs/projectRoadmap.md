# Data Hub Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals
- [x] Transition from Docker to systemd services
- [x] Implement system monitoring (data_hub_monitor service)
- [x] Implement network monitoring (network_monitor service)
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for network metrics
- [ ] Implement alerting system for metrics

## Current Features
### System Monitoring (Completed)
- [x] CPU usage tracking
- [x] Memory usage monitoring
- [x] Disk usage tracking
- [x] Temperature monitoring
- [x] System uptime tracking
- [x] Metrics stored in InfluxDB
- [x] Running as systemd service

### Network Monitoring (Completed)
- [x] Bandwidth usage tracking
- [x] Network errors and packet drops
- [x] Connected devices discovery
- [x] Speed testing (hourly)
- [x] Metrics stored in InfluxDB
- [x] Running as systemd service
