# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Implement network monitoring functionality
- Update project documentation for new architecture
- Set up version control for new implementation

## Context
We've transitioned from a Docker-based implementation to systemd services for better system integration and simpler maintenance. The network monitoring service has been implemented and is currently running on the system.

## Completed Steps
1. Created network_monitor.py service
   - Implemented bandwidth monitoring
   - Added device discovery
   - Integrated speed testing
   - Set up InfluxDB bucket

2. Set up systemd service
   - Created service file
   - Configured for automatic startup
   - Verified running status

3. Documentation Updates
   - Updated README.md for new architecture
   - Created project roadmap
   - Removed Docker-related content

4. Version Control
   - Created feature/network-monitoring branch
   - Committed initial implementation
   - Updated documentation

## Next Steps
1. Create Grafana Dashboards (from projectRoadmap.md)
   - [ ] Network performance dashboard
   - [ ] Device tracking dashboard
   - [ ] Speed test results visualization

2. Implement Alerting (from projectRoadmap.md)
   - [ ] Define alert thresholds
   - [ ] Set up notification system
   - [ ] Test alert triggers

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Create detailed service configuration guide
   - [ ] Document Grafana dashboard setup
   - [ ] Update INSTALLATION.md with new steps

4. Testing & Optimization
   - [ ] Monitor resource usage
   - [ ] Optimize polling intervals if needed
   - [ ] Test long-term stability

## Current Blockers
None

## Notes
- Speed tests use approximately 33MB per test (~792MB per day)
- Current polling intervals:
  - Network metrics: 15 minutes
  - Device scanning: 15 minutes
  - Speed tests: 60 minutes
