# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Reorganize repository structure
- Update project documentation for new architecture
- Clean up Docker-related content

## Context
We've transitioned from a Docker-based implementation to systemd services for better system integration and simpler maintenance. We're now focusing on cleaning up the repository structure to match our architectural decisions and removing Docker-related content.

## Completed Steps
1. Repository Cleanup
   - Created repo-cleanup branch
   - Moved network_monitor.py to services/network_monitor/
   - Updated README.md to remove Docker content
   - Aligned directory structure documentation with current implementation

2. Previous Implementation
   - Created network_monitor.py service
   - Implemented bandwidth monitoring
   - Added device discovery
   - Integrated speed testing
   - Set up InfluxDB bucket

3. Service Configuration
   - Created service file
   - Configured for automatic startup
   - Verified running status

4. Documentation Updates
   - Updated README.md for new architecture
   - Created project roadmap
   - Removed Docker-related content

## Next Steps
1. Remove Docker-related Files
   - [ ] Remove docker/ directory
   - [ ] Update any remaining documentation referencing Docker

2. Create Grafana Dashboards (from projectRoadmap.md)
   - [ ] Network performance dashboard
   - [ ] Device tracking dashboard
   - [ ] Speed test results visualization

3. Implement Alerting (from projectRoadmap.md)
   - [ ] Define alert thresholds
   - [ ] Set up notification system
   - [ ] Test alert triggers

4. Documentation
   - [ ] Create detailed service configuration guide
   - [ ] Document Grafana dashboard setup
   - [ ] Update INSTALLATION.md with new steps

5. Testing & Optimization
   - [ ] Monitor resource usage
   - [ ] Optimize polling intervals if needed
   - [ ] Test long-term stability

## Current Blockers
None

## Notes
- Speed tests use approximately 33MB per test (~792MB per day)
- Current polling intervals:
  - Network metrics: 15 minutes
  - Device scanning: 15 minutes
  - Speed tests: 60 minutes
